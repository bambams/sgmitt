You will need libal5poly here. It can be retrieved from my GitHub
repository:

  git clone git://github.com/bamccaig/libal5poly.git

${root}/deps/libal5poly/include should refer to the libal5poly include
directory and ${root}/deps/libal5poly/bin/libal5poly.1.dll should refer to
the Windows DLL. You can build that with the Makefile.mingw file (which is
a hack, but seems to work for now).

You will also need Boost's headers (download a distribution and copy the
'boost' subdirectory full of headers into some include directory e.g.,
your toolchain or even this project).

You will need Allegro 5. Download the Allegro 5 binaries and install it
into your compiler toolchain or somewhere else that your environment will
find it e.g., inside your MinGW tree.
